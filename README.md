# Face Mask Detection
Machine learning to detect facemasks.

## Dataset
Thanks to [prajnasb](https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiements/data/with_mask) for providing 
the face mask data set for this project.

The total dataset contains ZZZ images, XXX images without mask and YYY images with masks. 
The dataset was collected by using unique images of people without masks and then afterwards a portion of the data
was processed using facial landmarks to augment subjects wearing masks.
