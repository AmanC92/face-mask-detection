## Dataset
Thanks to [prajnasb](https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiements/data/with_mask) for providing 
the face mask data set for this project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiements/data).

The total dataset contains **641 images**, _320 images without a mask_ and *321 images with mask*s.
The dataset contains both real and augmented images of unique people wearing masks. The augmented images were collected 
by using unique images of people without masks and then afterwards the images
were processed using facial landmarks to augment subjects wearing masks.
